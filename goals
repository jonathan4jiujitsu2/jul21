Goal 1: Become trained with RF simulation software applications

Status: Completed
Summary:
Completed training and gained hands-on experience with HFSS, ADS, and MATLAB. I now feel confident using these tools to support RF filter design, automation, and simulation workflows.

Goal 2: Develop script files in support of improving HFSS efficiencies

Status: In Progress
Summary:
Developed and integrated an 800-line script into the RF Autonomous Tool. The script generates a filter structure with adjustable parameters, but it does not yet match the intended layout. Further debugging is in progress to correct layout issues, particularly with complex microstrip transitions.

Goal 3: Develop script to detect vehicle entering and exiting parking lot

Status: Completed
Summary:
Built a Python-based system that detects vehicle entry and exit using ultrasonic sensors, timestamps events with an RTC, and logs the data. The system runs reliably for the full duration of a shift and supports future expansion.
